EternalHarvest is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin designed to simulate the growth of plants (crops, saplings) and manage their growth even when the server is offline or the chunk is unloaded. It achieves this by persisting plant growth data in an SQLite database (plant_growth.db). The plugin ensures that plants continue to grow based on real-time elapsed since their last update, mimicking natural growth cycles.
